# Mini Data Analysis (MDA) - STAT545
*by Juliana Vieira*

## Introduction 📎
This repository enclose activities and files for the mini data analysis project in STAT 545 course (UBC).\
It is a project divided in two deliverables to develop skills to manipulate and visualize data.\
In particular, this repository will focus in a dataset about 'Vancouver Trees' and will explore some relashinships between tree distribuition and height.

## Repository Files 📁
- `README.md`: The document you are currently reading, which provides essential context to the repository.
- `Mini Data-Analysis Deliverable 1.rmd` : This file is addressing the first delivareble tasks. Practice of dplyr and ggplot2 with a research question in mind.
- `Mini-Data-Analysis-Deliverable-1.md` : A "knitted" version of the `Mini Data-Analysis Deliverable 1.rmd` file described above for Github visualization.
- `Mini Data-Analysis Deliverable 2.rmd` : This file is addressing the second delivareble tasks. Practice using tables and graphs, manipulating special data types in R, using tidyr, fitting a model object, and extract a result.
Reading and writing data as separate files.
We will also explore more in depth the concept of tidy data.
- `Mini-Data-Analysis-Deliverable-2.md` : A "knitted" version of the `Mini Data-Analysis Deliverable 2.rmd` file described above for Github visualization.
- `.gitignore`: It is used by git to avoid tracking superfluous files.
- `Output` folder: It is used as a path when generating output files.
- `mda-jmfvieira11/Mini-Data-Analysis-Deliverable-1_files` and `mda-jmfvieira11/Mini-Data-Analysis-Deliverable-2_files`folders: It is where figures from `.md` files is stored.
